## Overview

QRme is a mobile application with both physical attendance tracking and event management capabilities. It will simplify the tedious process of manual attendance tracking and provide robust functions for event administrators and event invitees. 

To manage attendance, the admin has three options: (1) Using the mobile app, the admin can scan invited Usersâ€™ phones, marking them present to the event, (2) the admin can print a QR code which is scanned by each attendee using their own phone, or (3) the admin can manually update the attendance through the web interface.  As an invitee, Users can join open events or leave existing events. They can record their own attendance or present their phone to be scanned by the event admin. Invitees can also view their own attendance record and event schedule for one or more events. Furthermore, invitees can participate in event forums, polls, and download content related to the event. Invitees can choose to receive email notifications about an event.

## Installation
